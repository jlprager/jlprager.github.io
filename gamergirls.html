            <h2 class="inline">The problem</h2>
            <p class="inline"> that I suspect is that female gamers are negatively affected by the stigma of "girl gamers". If any other women playing video games have had the same experience as myself while playing games online, then I'm sure that they're just as frustrated with their treatment. The video game community, whether intentionally or not, has sexualized women in gaming for a long time and women who play games have experienced backlash.</p>

                <p>While planning out this project, I wanted to see if there was any demand. I realized that my experience online may be isolated, but I wanted to talk to other female gamers to confirm my suspicion either way. I posted in Reddit asking other women if they'd be interested in participating (interviews and prototyping if it got that far) and the response seemed pretty positive. I interviewed about 20 women from this subreddit alone.</p>
