		<p>When planning my moodboards, I knew that I wanted vibrancy, gamification &amp; hints of utilitarianism. For example, I knew that the colors had to be dynamic, but that I'd be using "Roboto" as my font due to its clean lines and its easy recognition. I tried to find the balance between excitement and familiarity.

			<p>One of the more complicated decisions I had to make was the type of images to use throughout my splash page.<br>I tried experimenting with high-res photography, but they all felt very static and failed to convey the personality that I wanted the page to have.<br>I decided to use a more lively &amp; active photo that's representative of the gaming community. Using banners from various games ensures easy recognition, excitement and recognizability.</p>


	<!-- WIREFRAMES -->
		<h2 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h2>
		<p>Initially, I found it difficult to create something "new". After revising a few versions, I realized that it wasn't necessary to create something that hasn't been seen, but to display my information in the most interesting &amp; user friendly way. <br>Ultimately, I decided that I needed to showcase as much imagery as possible while integrating small pockets of text.</p>
