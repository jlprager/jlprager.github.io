				<h2>My Journey</h2>
				<h3 class="inline">I am a </h3>
				<p class="inline">Bay Area native who loves all things design, technology and gaming. I graduated from University of San Francisco in May 2015 with a Bachelor's in Politics and a minor concenteation in Legal Studies. Most of my studies included advocacy and a focus in helping underrepresented communities. However, through my studies, I realized that the most effective way to help people in need might be through technology. Before I graduated, I took some Computer Science classes to test the waters and began my journey into tech.<br> After graduation, I enrolled in a programming bootcamp hoping to learn about Front End Web Development. While my programming skills got stronger, I was drawn to the User Experience &amp; Design aspects of web. I took some classes in Visual Design and User Experience Design and am currently a User Experience Researcher &amp; Designer. My background in politics gives me a unique understanding of human nature and working with so many high-risk indiviudals taught me how to design for different social groups.</p>
