			<!-- <div class="col-12 problemHeader"> -->
				<h2 class="inline">The problem </h2>
				<p class="inline">that I suspected was that people have a difficult time picking a new video game to purchase when theyâ€™re done with the game that they most recently purchased due to expense or lack of knowledge/industry. I knew that my teammates and I had this problem and I wanted to see if we were alone.</p>

				<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jakandtesty">twitch.tv/JakAndTesty</a>
				<p>In order to find my users, I took to Twitch. I thought that the best way to find users and potential interviewees was to look within my own Twitch viewership. I streamed myself playing a popular game (Overwatch) and would occassionally bring my project up to vieweres to see if there was any interest. I didn't expect the response to be as positive as it was.

				<h2>The Interviews</h2>
				<p>I interviewed a diverse group of people. They varied in age range, experience with video games, average income, and gender. The questions I asked were centered around my interviewee's experiences with searching for &amp; purchasing new games. I wanted to find out if there were commonalities between their experiences, whether it be positive or negative. You can find a copy of my interview questions <a href="syncInterviewQuestions.html">here</a>.</p><br>

				<h3>What I discovered</h3>
				<p>I learned that almost all of my users, despite gender/game experience/frequency of play or purchase, utilize <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> dispite their dislike of the UX &amp; UI. Through my interviews, I determined that Steam was my most direct competitor. </p><br>
				<p>I also decided that based on what my users said, I should be thinking about making a recommendation system that cuts a user's search time so they have more time to play the game they purchase rather than spend up to "3 months looking for a new game because nothing looks good and everything looks the same".</p>

			<h2>The First Pivot</h2>
			<div class="row-12">
				<p>Throughout the course of this project, I learned that UX is all about pivots. Considering that I come from a web dev background, and legal studies prior to that, the sheer idea of pivots was (and still is) horrifying. However, it was a necessary step and allowed me to finely tune my project.<br> One of the key pieces of knowledge that I learned throughout my interviews was that there's a lot of "reading between the lines". Sometimes, people have a hard time saying what they mean so it's my job to think about what they say in order to figure out what they really mean.<br> All of my interviewees mentioned that they wanted a recommendation system that would steer them towards the game of their dreams. However, what I realized that they needed wasn't necessarily a recommendation system but a database. My users needed a place where they could sit down and use one outlet to search for games because despite their thinking that the lack of recommendations was their painpoint, I learned that the true painpoint was how much time went into looking through different outlets. For example, my users said that due to the lack of universal databases available, they'd have to look through Youtube, Metacritic, Twitch, etc. Hence the pivot. I was now striving to make a database of games.

				<p>There's a huge difference between "Can this be mobile?" vs "Should this be mobile?" and the difference kept me up for 3 nights. Could I make my database mobile? Absolutely! It's an easy enough adjustment to make and wouldn't really set me back in any way. However, I had an aching feeling that I shouldn't even consider a mobile concept. Based on my knowledge and experience in various video game communities, I had a strong suspicion that it wouldn't be well received.<br>However, the most important lesson that I learned from my mentor was to always <strong>fight for the user</strong> and to do so, I had to explore mobile wireframes.</p>

			<h2>The Final Pivot</h2>
			<div class="col-12">
				<p>That feeling when all of your users/testers hate mobile. And that they hated me now. I know it sounds silly, but the gaming community isn't known for its warmth or loving nature. It broke my soul knowing how much effort I put into making a great mobile product just to have my previous testers refuse to touch it because it was now mobile.<br>It's ok though. I decided that mobile was the right answer and that I just had to make my users see the potential that I did. For the final time, my project pivoted into something new. Despite the technology being a little more on the "I'm not sure if this is even possible" side, I realized that I needed to give my users what they wanted at the core of the problem. They wanted to be ensured that game time meant that they got to play, not spend time digging through games in order to find the right one to play.<br>My new product became a mobile app that allowed a user to look up games, research them on a single page, and download them from the phone, sync to their home desktop, and have the game ready to play by the time they arrive home. Thankfully, when I pitched the idea, I got much more positive feedback.</p>
